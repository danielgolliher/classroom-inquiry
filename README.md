# Classroom Space Inquiry

I’m Daniel Golliher, and I’ll be teaching [The Foundations of New York](https://maximumnewyork.com/school/) this fall. It’s a six-week class designed to give students a full grounding in New York City government and basic law. I’m looking for a classroom to host two (possibly three) sections of my class a week, each with about 10 students, and each for two hours. [Guidepost Montessori at Museum Mile](https://www.guidepostmontessori.com/schools/museum-mile-new-york-ny) would be a wonderful location if it’s available. Below are further details to consider.

## About the instructor:
* Founder of [Maximum New York](https://maximumnewyork.com/)
* [Tweets regularly](https://twitter.com/danielgolliher) about NYC/S and how to make them better
* See his [LinkedIn](https://twitter.com/danielgolliher) for details on past professional endeavors 
* Harvard College, class of 2014, degree in government

## About the class:
* Six weeks long, from the week of September 5 through the week of October 10, with one extra week as makeup if necessary.
* The class will be taught in two (perhaps three) separate sections of ~10 students each.
* Each session is two hours long.
* The classes will take place on weekday evenings in the 6pm-9pm window, although weekends can work if needed.
* There is a final exam that students must pass in order to graduate. These exams will be scheduled at the students’ and instructor’s mutual convenience. 
* There will be a graduation event for the students one to two weeks after the class ends.
* [Here is the syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fT6f1qxDSZjlfD4Xy8Vf5JCtXOqrtDg8stSsiWEVLJ8/edit?usp=sharing) for the recently completed cohort 2. It is being updated for cohorts 3+.
* The class is part of the overall project of Maximum New York (linked above). 

## The classroom space requirements:
* Can accommodate ~10 people, with a whiteboard
* Small snacks and non-alcoholic drinks allowed
* A two-hour block of time within the 6-9pm window, twice a week in the evenings, from the week of 9/5 through 10/10
* Nice to have: live streaming capabilities (otherwise the instructor will provide his own equipment)
